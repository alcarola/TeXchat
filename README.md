# TeXchat

## About

TeXchat is a simple web chat service that renders TeX math.

The goal is to make it trivially easy to have a conversation with
someone else in the web, using mathematical symbols.

Currently, the prettiest math rendering is TeX math, which
[http://www.mathjax.org/](MathJax) has ellegantly brought to the web. This is
coupled with a simple chat service on top of socket.io.

If you have any suggestions, feedback, issues, etc: please start a topic in the
[http://github.com/jbenet/TeXchat/issues](github issues) page.
Feel free to contact the author directly, but github is preferable.

TeXchat is built by [http://github.com/jbenet](Juan Batiz-Benet).
